# Pydantic Folder Documentation

This folder contains Python scripts that demonstrate various features and use cases of the Pydantic library. Pydantic is a powerful data validation and settings management library for Python, leveraging Python type hints. Below is a detailed description of each file and the concepts it covers.

## **Detailed Explanation of Key Concepts**

### 1. **Field Validators**
Field validators are used to validate and transform individual fields in a Pydantic model. They ensure that the data provided for a specific field meets the required criteria.

- **Example Use Case**: Validating that an email address belongs to a specific domain.
- **Key Features**:
  - Custom validation logic for fields.
  - Data transformation (e.g., converting names to uppercase).

---

### 2. **Model Validators**
Model validators are used to validate the entire model after all fields have been populated. This is useful for ensuring consistency between multiple fields.

- **Example Use Case**: Ensuring that a start date is earlier than an end date in a scheduling application.
- **Key Features**:
  - Cross-field validation.
  - Ensures logical consistency in the data.

---

### 3. **Computed Fields**
Computed fields are dynamically generated based on other fields in the model. These fields are not provided by the user but are derived from existing data.

- **Example Use Case**: Automatically calculating the full name of a user from their first and last names.
- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic field generation.
  - Simplifies data processing by automating derived values.

---

### 4. **Nested Models**
Nested models allow for the validation of complex, hierarchical data structures. A Pydantic model can include other models as fields, enabling recursive validation.

- **Example Use Case**: Validating a JSON object representing a user profile with nested address and contact details.
- **Key Features**:
  - Supports complex data structures.
  - Recursive validation of nested fields.

---

### 5. **General Validation**
The `pydantic_check.py` script demonstrates various Pydantic utilities and features, including error handling and general validation techniques.

- **Example Use Case**: Experimenting with Pydantic features to understand their behavior.
- **Key Features**:
  - Error handling and reporting.
  - Exploration of Pydantic's capabilities.

## **How to Use These Scripts**
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure that Pydantic is installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pydantic
